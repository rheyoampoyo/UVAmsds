My name is Rheyan Ampoyo and I am a first-year graduate student in the UVA MSDS online program. During the past year of my undergraduate program, I have been teaching myself the ins and outs of tools in Python that are relevant to the field of Data Science through a third-party program called DataCamp.

During the capstone class of my undergraduate program, I had the opportunity to work with SpaceX to assist them in writing an entirely new algorithm to replace their outdated Excel macro code to display graphs of safe rocket launch parameters from the coast of Cape Canaveral. This was all done through both R and Python.

I am excited to meet my fellow students and work with you throughout the program.
